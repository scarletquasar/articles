If you are a .NET developer and always wondered if it was possible to have a quality time when developing in VSCode, or for some reason needs to use the editor instead of Visual Studio - it is possible and keeping all the basic functionalities with quality. In this article I will show how I adapted my VSCode (personal and professional - they are separated) to run that tech.

## Initial setup

If you are using .NET for the first time or perhaps setting up a computer from zero, I recommend you to install .NET 8 or superior, just in order to make the **C# Dev Kit** extension work properly when you first install it. After that, you can have the .NET versions that you want to work on. You can check the options to install dotnet [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).
