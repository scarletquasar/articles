If you are a .NET developer and always wondered if it was possible to have a quality time when developing in VSCode, or for some reason needs to use the editor instead of Visual Studio - it is possible and keeping all the basic functionalities with quality. In this article I will show how I adapted my VSCode (personal and professional - they are separated) to run that tech.

## Initial setup

If you are using .NET for the first time or perhaps setting up a computer from zero, I recommend you to install .NET 8 or superior, just in order to make the **C# Dev Kit** extension work properly when you first install it (we will discuss more about it in the next section). After that, you can have the .NET versions that you want to work on. You can check the options to install dotnet [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/). After setting everything up with your dotnet versions, we can start thinking about the extensions that we can install.

## A quick overview about the extensions

Clearly, we are going to use a lot of extensions to mimic the .NET features that we have in Visual Studio, I personally don't see it as a bad thing, but it can vary from person to person. It is also important to clarify that this article follows my experience and these extensions can not be the exact perfect fit for you, but they were - and are - for me, and for a long time (that's why I am writing this article). The extensions are:

- **Main ones**
  - .NET Core Test Explorer
  - .NET Stalker Debugger
  - C# Dev Kit
  - C# Curly Formatter
  - C# Namespace Completion
  - Visual NuGet
- **Optional ones (only appearance)**
  - Studio Icons
  - Visual Studio 2019 Theme
